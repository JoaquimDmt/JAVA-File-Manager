# Lecteur Fichier JAVA

This is one of my first project in java, it allows to create and manage files directly with java code.

You can :

- Open or create a file
- Write text directly in the selected file
- Display de the file content to read it
- Read backwards in terms of lines
- Compare two files
- See Information about the file (name, path, size, ...)
- Show the list of every created files
- Change from a file to an other
- Delete the selected file

## Getting Started

To run the program, simply go in dist folder and execute the following command : `java fr.lpwm.joaquim.Main`
You can also just run the java files in src, way to do depending on your IDE (ex: VisualStudioCode -> F5 in Main.java).

If you make changes in src files, then you can recompile everything with `javac -encoding utf8 *.java` and place the new .class files in dist/fr/lpwm/joaquim folder.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `dist`: the folder to run class files
- `fichiers`: where the program files are created while executing Main.java.
